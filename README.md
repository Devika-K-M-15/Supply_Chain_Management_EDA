## Introduction


## Data Exploration


## Data Preprocessing
This project mainly focus on analyzing impact of features provided in the dataset on target variable product weight. 

### 1. Drop unwanted columns


### 2. Missing values

## Suggestions

- Focus on expanding warehouse operations in rural areas to capitalize on the higher average product weights and the larger share of total product weight, which can potentially lead to increased overall productivity and profitability.
- Prioritize investment in temperature regulating machines and enhancing electric supply availability for warehouses to improve product weight and overall warehouse performance.
- It is evident that, as production increases, storage issue increases. Hence, storage capacity must be upgraded to accomodate higher product weights. This highlights the importance of regularly assessing and expanding storage infrastructure in line with the production increments to ensure smooth warehouse operations and prevent bottlenecks.
- Implement proactive maintanance protocols. Invest in scalable solutions to accomodate higher production levels while minimizing the risk of operational disruptions caused by breakdowns. Conduct comprehensive analysis to identify root causes of braekdowns during periods of heightened production.
- Explore quality standards associated with different government approval grades. Identify opportunities to enhance product quality standards across all warehouse facilities.
- Workers number does not significantly affect production. Examine various factors such as technology adoption, training programs, and workflow optimization strategies to understand their collective impact on production efficiency.
